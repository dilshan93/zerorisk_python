Failure to properly implement this measure results in the entity being vulnerable to unauthorized access by malicious individuals or software.<br/>For firewall functionality to be effective, it must be properly configured to control and/or limit traffic into and out of the entity's network.</p>
pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.2.text=Do firewall and router configurations restrict connections between untrusted networks and any system in the cardholder data environment as follows: Note: An “untrusted network” is any network that is external to the networks belonging to the entity under review, and/or which is out of the entity’s ability to control or manage.
pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.2.1.a.info=<p>Scanning of all inbound and outbound connections allows for inspection and restriction of traffic based on the source and/or destination address, thus preventing unfiltered access between untrusted and trusted environments. This prevents malicious individuals from accessing the entity's network via unauthorized IP addresses or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner (for example, to send data they've obtained from within the entity's network out to an untrusted server).<br/>Implementing a rule that denies all inbound and outbound traffic that is not specifically needed helps preventing inadvertent vulnerabilities that would allow unintended and potentially harmful traffic in or out.</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.2.3.info=<p>Using a wireless technology within a network is a common practice for malicious individuals to gain access to the network and cardholder data. If a wireless device or network is installed and the entity is not aware of this operation, a malicious individual could easily and "invisibly" enter the network.<br/>If your organization has multiple wireless networks, a firewall should be used to block traffic of credit card data between the authorized zone and the wireless network.<br/>For small environments, this requirement might not be applicable as the only method of connectivity (wireless network) might be represented by a single network device (i.e. Internet router).

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.3.info=<p>While there may be legitimate reasons for untrusted connections to be permitted to DMZ systems (e.g., to allow public access to a Web server), such connections should never be granted to systems in the internal network. A firewall's intent is to manage and control all connections between public and internal systems, especially those that store, process or transmit cardholder data. If direct access is allowed between public systems and the cardholder data environment (CDE), the protections offered by the firewall are bypassed, and system components storing cardholder data may be exposed to compromise.</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.3.2.text=Is inbound Internet traffic limited to IP addresses within the DMZ?
pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.3.3.info=<p>Normally a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it, so other computers in the network know where the packet came from. Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address so that the target system believes the packet is from a trusted source. Filtering packets coming into the network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not "spoofed" to look like they are coming from an organization's own internal network.<br/>Always check that your firewall or router is able to grant protection against spoofing attacks (this feature is embedded and activated in most domestic routers).</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.3.4.info=<p>All outbound traffic from the network, including systems handling credit card data, should be parsed to ensure that it follows established, authorized rules. Connections should be inspected to restrict traffic to authorized communications only (for example by restricting source/destination addresses/ports, and/or blocking of content).<br/>Most firewalls or routers can be set to prevent specific internal systems from reaching unwanted destinations.</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.3.4.text=Is outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the Internet explicitly authorized?
pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_1.3.5.info=<p><p>By remembering the "state" (or status) for each connection (<i>Established</i> connection), the firewall can assess whether an apparent response to a previous connection is actually a valid, authorized response (as it remembers the status of each connection) or it is malicious traffic trying to cheat the firewall into allowing the connection.<br/> In most firewalls or routers this feature is included and factory-enabled.</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_4.milestone=Protect Cardholder Data
pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_4.section=Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks
pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_4.1.a.info=<p>This requirement only applies if card data is transferred from internally owned systems to third-party systems for transaction processing purposes, i.e. from eCommerce sites or POS terminals. If you do not have direct ownership of transfer systems (i.e. POS terminals connected via Internet to your bank), it is advisable contacting the relevant service provider to confirm that this requirement (not necessarily applicable to your organization) is met.</p><p>Sensitive information should be encrypted when transferred over public networks, because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit.<br/>Secure transmission of cardholder data requires using trusted keys/certificates, a secure protocol for transport, and proper encryption strength to encrypt cardholder data. Connection requests from systems that do not support the required encryption strength, and that would result in a non-secure connection, should not be accepted.<br/>Note that some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain control of the affected system. Whichever security protocol is used, ensure it is configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of non-secure connections - for example, by using only trusted certificates and supporting only strong encryption (not supporting weaker, non-secure protocols or methods).<br/>Verifying that certificates are trusted (for example, have not expired and are issued from a trusted source) helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection.<br/>Generally, the Web page URL should begin with "HTTPS" and/or the Web browser display a padlock icon somewhere in the window of the browser. Many TLS certificate vendors also provide a highly visible verification seal, sometimes referred to as a "security seal," "secure site seal," or "secure trust seal"), which can be clicked on to reveal information about the Web site.</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_6.1.info=<p>The intent of this requirement is that organizations stay up-to-date with new vulnerabilities that may impact their environment.<br/>Sources for vulnerability information should be trustworthy and often include vendor Web sites, industry newsgroups, mailing list, or RSS feeds.<br/>Once an organization identifies a vulnerability that could affect its environment, the risk that the vulnerability poses must be evaluated and ranked. The organization must therefore have a method in place to evaluate vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and assign risk rankings to those vulnerabilities. This is not achieved by an ASV scan or internal vulnerability scan, but rather requires a process to actively monitor industry sources for vulnerability information.<br/>Classifying the risks (for example, as "high," "medium," or "low") allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items more quickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be exploited.</p>

For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected. Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization's environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk" to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical" if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.

pciquestion_3.2.1_mr_11.3.info=<p>The aim of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with the goal of identifying how far an attacker would be able to penetrate into an environment. This allows an entity to gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks.<br/>A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.<br/>Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, testers mostly use their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, he will then use the compromised server as a starting point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. <i>Penetration testing techniques will be different for different organizations, and the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the organization's risk assessment.</i></p>

The organization must therefore have a method in place to evaluate vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and assign risk rankings to those vulnerabilities. This is not achieved by an ASV scan or internal vulnerability scan, but rather requires a process to actively monitor industry sources for vulnerability information.<br/>Classifying the risks (for example, as "high," "medium," or "low") allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items more quickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be exploited.</p>

For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected. Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization's environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk" to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical" if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.

pciquestion_3.2.1_sp_11.3.info=<p>The aim of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with the goal of identifying how far an attacker would be able to penetrate into an environment. This allows an entity to gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks.<br/>A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.<br/>Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, testers mostly use their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, he will then use the compromised server as a starting point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. <i>Penetration testing techniques will be different for different organizations, and the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the organization's risk assessment.</i></p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_sp_A2.1.info=<p>This requirement only applies to POI/POS (payment terminals) if connected to your acquiring bank through a public Internet connection. Mark this requirement as <strong>Not Applicabile</strong> in any other cases (i.e. dial-out connection), otherwise pls contact your terminal provider to get support about using non-secure transmission protocol, namely for this PCI DSS requirement.</p>

pciquestion_3.2.1_sp_A2.2.info=POS POI termination points, including but not limited to a service providers such as an acquirer or acquirer processor, can continue using SSL/early TLS when it can be shown that the service provider has controls in place that mitigate the risk of supporting those connections for the service provider environment. The Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan is a document prepared by the entity that details their plans for migrating to a secure protocol, and also describes controls the entity has in place to reduce the risk associated with SSL/early TLS until the migration is complete. Service providers should communicate to all customers using SSL/early TLS about the risks associated with its use and need to migrate to a secure protocol. Refer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL/early TLS for further guidance on Risk Mitigation and Migration Plans
